There is a small thing i forgot to add

The Google map allows you to view a particular site at different time periods 

So you can see the level of development at a place say 5yrs ago and say 1 Yr ago

So I want to be able to pick the various data I talked of within circular distance or areas but also at different time periods say the same site today and say 5yrs ago

How does the variables change over time

Hope you get me
